      <h2 class="page-title">Project 7 - Calculating time elapsed since a given date</h2>
      <p><em>Expand your individual website to include a page that calculates the time elapsed since a date entered by a user. The page should include a form that allows users to enter a day, month, and year. The page should then calculate and display the elapsed time in years, months, and days. Note that your program must include code to convert day values in excess of 31 into months, and months in excess of 12 into years.</em></p>
      <h3 class="page-title">How Much Time Has Passed Since...</h3>
	  <p>Enter a start date in the field below then click calculate to see how much time has passed since then.</p>
      <form>
		  <fieldset>
            <p id ="today"></p>
          </fieldset>
          <fieldset>
            <label for="startDate">
              Enter any Date:
            </label>
			  <input type="date" id="startDate"/>&emsp;
			  <button type="button" id="calculate">Calculate!</button>&emsp;
			  <button type="button" id="reset">Reset Form</button>
          </fieldset>
          <fieldset>
             <p>Result:</p>
            <p id="result"></p>
			<p id="result2"></p>
          </fieldset>
     </form>
	<p>The script here creates 2 date objects: one for the current date/time, one for the user-entered date/time. Each of those values is converted into milliseconds, which are then further converted into years, months and days using division and the Math.floor function to find wholly divisible numbers. Also, I used this to see how off I was: <a href="https://www.convertunits.com/dates/" target="_blank">convertunits.com</a></p>
	<p><strong>Worth Noting:</strong>
		<ol>
			<li>When a 01 is entered as the day for a previous year, the result text will display the previous month, but will add day to the total days in that month (for example, January 1 gets you 12/32 as if December 32nd was the start date). The total difference in days is correct and I'm simply calling the variables pulled from the form, so I don't know why that's happening. It's the way the date object holds the months and days in an array that I just haven't figured out yet. I'd need to write a switch statement and convert those to month strings to fix that, or something.</li>
			<li>Additionally, when a future date is plugged in (try a date exactly 1 year from now) it will say "11 months and 23 days from now", since the math here does not take into account months with 28, 29 or 30 days. That's an obvious fix, but I'm pressed for time and it wasn't a requirement ;) . If you enter a date that is 1 year and 2 days in the future, the answer corrects itself. (See my next point about whole days and math)</li>
			<li>Finally, the calculations on dates are using Math.floor, which returns only whole numbers. If you enter the date for tomorrow, the resultant text will say this is 1 day from now... but if you enter a date 2 days from now, it will still say it's 1 day from now, since the first day was technically less than 1 whole day. This is an issue with the millisecond division and whole numbers, which would need a statement that includes the rounded-off days to count them as whole days.</li>
		</ol>... but I think that's it. Any suggestions?</p>
