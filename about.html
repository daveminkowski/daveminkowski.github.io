      <p> 
		  Hello There!
      </p>
      <p> 
		  I completely lack imagination and have no idea what to make a website about, so I'll just uh, talk about myself for a minute? </p><p>My name is Dave, and I'm a student at MCC taking courses to complete my AA in computer programming. I'm currently employed as a paramedic for AMR here in Mesa, Arizona, and I'm sort of... exploring my career options. Programming has been a hobby of mine since high school - in truth, it was my other "favorite" career option at the time, but I ultimately chose to pursue Emergency Medical Services and I've been at it for the past 15 years. I moved here from San Clemente, CA (that's the San Clemente pier on the home page) back in early 2005. I've worked at AMR (formerly Southwest Ambulance) right here in Mesa, Arizona ever since. My station is actually right in the area of MCC at Dobson & Broadway, so if you attend other classes here at MCC you may have seen me in the ambulance.

		This is my first real attempt at a website and my understanding of html & css is extremely limited. Now that I think about it, it seems odd that I'd keep up with (some) programming over the years yet never once be involved with a side project which incorporated any real web development. It seems like a neat field with a lot of creative freedom - and it's obviously a valuable skill.
		</p><p>If our own websites are where we'll be leaving our assignments for the semester, hopefully I'll see some improvement in the interface and design of this website. I look forward to leeching ideas from you all!.</p>
		<p>- Dave</p>
